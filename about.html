                    The hotel is designed in such a way that one can enjoy the
                    enchanting view of celestial Ganges and also the greenery of serene
                    Himalayan hills covered with natural forests. The area around the
                    hotel is surrounded by the world-famous ashrams some of them exist
                    for more than 100 years now; their presence itself makes the
                    atmosphere so divine that one feels drawn to his own peace and
                    tranquility inside himself.
